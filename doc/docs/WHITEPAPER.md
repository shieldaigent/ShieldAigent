# ShieldAigent Whitepaper: A Journey into the Unknown

## Introduction
Welcome to *ShieldAigent*—a decentralized platform where AI, IoT, and community governance converge to protect the digital world. Our token, SHIELD, launches on the Base network via Cliza in April 2025, marking the genesis of a transformative journey. This whitepaper unveils our path, but shadows linger at the edges. Each milestone reveals a piece of the puzzle, while others remain cloaked in mystery, waiting for the right moment to emerge.

## Vision
- Detect and prevent cyber threats across web1, web2, and web3 using AI.
- Share market security trends for stocks, gold, bonds, crypto, and crude oil.
- Empower the community through governance and real-world devices.

## Tokenomics
- Total Supply: 1 billion SHIELD tokens.
- Allocation:
  - 80% to the community (public sale via Cliza launchpad).
  - 20% to the team (vested over 9 months, starting April 2025).
- Launch Price: 1 SHIELD = $0.10.
- Utility: SHIELD powers governance and access to premium features. Hold SHIELD to vote in our DAO, access AI-driven phishing detection, and activate real-world devices like the *ShieldAigent Guardian*.
